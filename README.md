# Time-Series-Analysis
## Overview:
Time series data is data that is collected at different points in time. This is opposed to cross-sectional data which observes individuals, companies, etc. at a single point in time. Because data points in time series are collected at adjacent time periods there is potential for correlation between observations. This is one of the features that distinguishes time series data from cross-sectional data.

## Time Series Patterns:
Most time series data usually have at least one of these three kinds of patterns: trend, seasonality, and/or cycles. Letâ€™s briefly describe each one.
## Time Series Smoothing in python:
1.	Moving Average Method
2.	Simple Exponential Smoothing:
3.	Holt Method for Exponential Smoothing

## Time Series Decomposition and stationarity Check:
1. Multiplicative Decomposition
2. Additive Decomposition:
3. Stationarity

## Augmented Dickey Fuller Test (ADF Test)
